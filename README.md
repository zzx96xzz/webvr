# webvr
Prerequisites
-----
The first step is to set up a local server for external network access <br>
Creating a Webvr scene with [Aâ€”frame](https://aframe.io/docs/0.9.0/introduction/installation.html) <br>
Download the Boilerplate on [Github](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe)
We also need to download the js build so that we can serve it ourselves <br>

Installing
-----
To use the latest stable build of A-frame : aframe-v0.9.0.js <br>
If used to develop and debug code, use the build of A-frame: aframe-master.js <br>
In the index.html file, we need to modify the the path of the aframe-masters.js if you serve it by yourself <br>

Running the tests
-----
Select an image that meets the requirements of webvr or a random image for the test, add it to a file on your local server, and read its path in index.html <br>
Open in your browser 127.0.0.1
